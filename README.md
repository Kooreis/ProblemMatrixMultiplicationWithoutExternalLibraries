# Question: How do you perform matrix multiplication without using external libraries? JavaScript Summary

The provided JavaScript code performs matrix multiplication without using any external libraries. The function `matrixMultiplication` takes two arguments, `matrixA` and `matrixB`, which are the two matrices to be multiplied. It initializes an empty array `result` to store the result of the multiplication. It then uses three nested loops to perform the multiplication. The outer loop iterates over the rows of `matrixA`, the middle loop iterates over the columns of `matrixB`, and the innermost loop performs the actual multiplication and addition. For each cell in the resulting matrix, it multiplies the corresponding row element in `matrixA` with the corresponding column element in `matrixB` and adds the product to a running total (`sum`). This sum is then stored in the corresponding cell of the `result` matrix. The function finally returns the `result` matrix, which is the product of the multiplication. The code also includes an example usage of the function, multiplying two 3x3 matrices and logging the result to the console.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is similar to the JavaScript version in terms of the logic used to perform matrix multiplication. Both versions use nested loops to iterate over the rows and columns of the input matrices, perform the multiplication, and store the results in a new matrix.

However, there are a few key differences between the two versions:

1. TypeScript uses static typing: In the TypeScript version, the types of the input matrices and the return type of the function are explicitly declared as `number[][]`, which represents a 2D array of numbers. This provides type safety, which can help prevent type-related errors that might occur during development.

2. Use of classes: The TypeScript version defines a class `MatrixMultiplication` and places the multiplication function inside it as a static method. This is more in line with object-oriented programming principles and can make the code easier to manage and reuse.

3. Error handling: The TypeScript version includes an additional check to ensure that the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. This is a requirement for matrix multiplication. If this condition is not met, it returns an empty matrix. This check is not present in the JavaScript version.

4. Variable declaration: The TypeScript version uses `let` for variable declaration which is block-scoped, unlike `var` which is function-scoped in JavaScript. This can help prevent potential issues with variable hoisting and scope.

Overall, the TypeScript version provides better type safety, structure, and error handling compared to the JavaScript version.

# C++ Differences

Both the JavaScript and C++ versions solve the problem using the same algorithmic approach, which is the standard method for matrix multiplication. They both use three nested loops to iterate over the rows of the first matrix, the columns of the second matrix, and the elements of the current row and column to compute the product.

However, there are some differences due to the language features and syntax:

1. Data Structures: In JavaScript, matrices are represented as arrays of arrays. In C++, matrices are represented as vectors of vectors. 

2. Initialization: In JavaScript, the result matrix is initialized as an empty array and each row is added as a new empty array. In C++, the result matrix is initialized with a specific size, which is determined by the sizes of the input matrices.

3. Loop Variables: JavaScript uses `let` to declare loop variables, while C++ uses `int`.

4. Size of Matrix: In JavaScript, the size of the matrix is obtained using the `length` property. In C++, the `size()` method is used.

5. Output: In JavaScript, the result is printed using `console.log()`. In C++, the result is printed using a loop and `cout`.

6. Function Declaration: In JavaScript, the function is declared using the `function` keyword. In C++, the function is declared with a return type of `vector<vector<int>>`.

7. Main Function: In JavaScript, there is no need for a main function. The code is executed sequentially. In C++, a `main()` function is required to run the program.

8. Passing Matrices to Function: In JavaScript, matrices are passed to the function directly. In C++, matrices are passed by reference to avoid copying the data.

9. Return Statement: In JavaScript, the result is returned using the `return` keyword. In C++, the result is also returned using the `return` keyword, but the function has a specified return type.
